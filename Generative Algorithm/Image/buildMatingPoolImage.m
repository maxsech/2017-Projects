% This function takes the fitness scores from the previous function
% and creates a sort of raffle by weighting the percentages so that

% leading to a random weighted mating pool that is normalized with the 
% highest fitness value in a population being equivalent to 1.

%         matingFactor -- a value used, such as ten, that is used to
%                         multiply by the member fitness percentage to
%                         determine the number of tickets the member adds
